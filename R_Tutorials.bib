@article{collins_analysis_2006,
	abstract = {This article argues that ideal longitudinal research is characterized by the seamless integration of three elements: (a) a well-articulated theoretical model of change observed using (b) a temporal design that affords a clear and detailed view of the process, with the resulting data analyzed by means of (c) a statistical model that is an operationalization of the theoretical model. Two general varieties of theoretical models are considered: models in which the time-related change of primary interest is continuous, and those in which it is characterized by movement between discrete states. In addition, two general types of temporal designs are considered: the longitudinal panel design and the intensive longitudinal design. For each general category of theoretical models, some of the analytic possibilities available for longitudinal panel designs and for intensive longitudinal designs are discussed. The article concludes with brief discussions of two issues particularly relevant to longitudinal research---missing data and measurement---and a few words about exploratory research.},

@article{grimm_nonlinear_2011,
	abstract = {Developmentalists are often interested in understanding change processes, and growth models are the most common analytic tool for examining such processes. Nonlinear growth curves are especially valuable to developmentalists because the defining characteristics of the growth process such as initial levels, rates of change during growth spurts, and asymptotic levels can be estimated. A variety of growth models are described beginning with the linear growth model and moving to nonlinear models of varying complexity. A detailed discussion of nonlinear models is provided, highlighting the added insights into complex developmental processes associated with their use. A collection of growth models are fit to repeated measures of height from participants of the Berkeley Growth and Guidance Studies from early childhood through adulthood.},

In this paper we describe how a variety of sigmoid curves can be fit using the Mplus structural modeling program and the non-linear mixed-effects modeling procedure {NLMIXED} in {SAS}. Using longitudinal achievement data collected as part of a study examining the effects of preschool instruction on academic gain we illustrate the procedures for fitting growth models of logistic, Gompertz, and Richards functions. Brief notes regarding the practical benefits, limitations, and choices faced in the fitting and estimation of such models are included.},

Over the years, many software packages for structural equation modeling have been developed, both free and commercial. However, perhaps the best state-of-the-art software packages in this field are still closed-source and/or commercial. The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. This paper explains the aims behind the development of the package, gives an overview of its most important features, and provides some examples to illustrate how lavaan works in practice.},

Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.},

@article{zeileis_various_2020,
	abstract = {Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just refer to "the" clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses). In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented approach to "robust" covariance matrix estimation  -  applicable beyond lm() and glm()  -  is available in the sandwich package but has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with sandwich 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for two generic functions (estfun() and bread()), clustered and panel covariances are provided in {vcovCL}(), {vcovPL}(), and {vcovPC}(). Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in {vcovBS}(), using model update() on bootstrap samples. These are directly applicable to models from packages including {MASS}, pscl, countreg, and betareg, among many others. Some empirical illustrations are provided as well as an assessment of the methods' performance in a simulation study.},

@article{zeileis_econometric_2004,
	abstract = {Data described by econometric models typically contains autocorrelation and/or heteroskedasticity of unknown form and for inference in such models it is essential to use covariance matrix estimators that can consistently estimate the covariance of the model parameters. Hence, suitable heteroskedasticity consistent ({HC}) and heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent ({HAC}) estimators have been receiving attention in the econometric literature over the last 20 years. To apply these estimators in practice, an implementation is needed that preferably translates the conceptual properties of the underlying theoretical frameworks into computational tools. In this paper, such an implementation in the package sandwich in the R system for statistical computing is described and it is shown how the suggested functions provide reusable components that build on readily existing functionality and how they can be integrated easily into new inferential procedures or applications. The toolbox contained in sandwich is extremely flexible and comprehensive, including specific functions for the most important {HC} and {HAC} estimators from the econometric literature. Several real-world data sets are used to illustrate how the functionality can be integrated into applications.},

For polytomous logit models, effect displays depict fitted category probabilities under the model, and can include point-wise confidence envelopes for the effects.  The construction of effect displays by functions in the effects package is essentially automatic. The package provides several kinds of displays for polytomous logit models.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled {REML} criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or {REML} criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

We have implemented the Satterthwaite's method for approximating degrees of freedom for the t and F tests. We have also implemented the construction of Type I - {III} {ANOVA} tables. Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the {KRmodcomp} function from the pbkrtest package).

The {ARCH} model is appropriate when the error variance in a time series follows an autoregressive ({AR}) model; if an autoregressive moving average ({ARMA}) model is assumed for the error variance, the model is a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ({GARCH}) model.
{ARCH} models are commonly employed in modeling financial time series that exhibit time-varying volatility and volatility clustering, i.e. periods of swings interspersed with periods of relative calm (this is, when the time series exhibits heteroskedasticity). {ARCH}-type models are sometimes considered to be in the family of stochastic volatility models, although this is strictly incorrect since at time t the volatility is completely predetermined (deterministic) given previous values.},

The authors' emphasis on conceptualizing and testing between-group differences in variance components is important because too few researchers consider and test these differences (more often the focus is on differences in means). The authors present data on adolescent smoking to (a) illustrate the conceptual importance of differences in within- and between-person variance and (b) clearly show how to proceed with testing these potential differences. An interesting detail that readers may find useful is that the authors demonstrate how to compare models of variance differences in which groups are considered nominal (i.e., the variances differ in an unspecified way across groups) versus ordinal (i.e., the variances differ in a specified way, such as in a linear manner, across successive groups).

Although models for heterogeneous variances have been utilized in group contexts (i.e., dispersion models), they are not usually applied in examinations of intraindividual variation.

	abstract = {Ecological momentary assessment and/or experience sampling methods are increasingly used in health studies to study subjective experiences within changing environmental contexts. In these studies, up to 30 or 40 observations are often obtained for each subject. Because there are so many measurements per subject, one can characterize a subject's mean and variance and can specify models for both. In this article, we focus on an adolescent smoking study using ecological momentary assessment where interest is on characterizing changes in mood variation. We describe how covariates can influence the mood variances and also extend the statistical model by adding a subject-level random effect to the within-subject variance specification. This permits subjects to have influence on the mean, or location, and variability, or (square of the) scale, of their mood responses. These mixed-effects location scale models have useful applications in many research areas where interest centers on the joint modeling of the mean and variance structure.},

	abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection.

	abstract = {Recursive partitioning is embedded into the general and well-established class of parametric models that can be fitted using M-type estimators (including maximum likelihood). An algorithm for model-based recursive partitioning is suggested for which the basic steps are: (1) fit a parametric model to a dataset; (2) test for parameter instability over a set of partitioning variables; (3) if there is some overall parameter instability, split the model with respect to the variable associated with the highest instability; (4) repeat the procedure in each of the daughter nodes. The algorithm yields a partitioned (or segmented) parametric model that can be effectively visualized and that subject-matter scientists are used to analyzing and interpreting.},

We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.},

	abstract = {This article illustrates the challenges and potential advantages associated with using a sequence-based method to describe the structure of individual residential mobility histories. The authors examine the existence and prevalence of distinctive patterns of residential mobility across a rural-suburban-urban place-type continuum. They identify a finite set of empirically common residential trajectories that describe patterns of movement across the geographic landscape. This approach reveals (1) a great deal of stability in patterns of residential attachment; (2) that residential movement is frequently organized in terms of place-type, rather than in terms of specific locations; and (3) that certain place-types are rarely linked together in residential histories, which suggests that the universe of place-types contains social boundaries. Combining the empirically observed residential trajectories with basic demographic characteristics of individuals confirms general expectations from the life course perspective about the roles and positions individuals occupy over different stages of adulthood.},

Special emphasis is put on the multiple ways of visualizing sequences. The core element of the package is the state se- quence object in which we store the set of sequences together with attributes such as the alphabet, state labels and the color palette. The functions can then easily retrieve this information to ensure presentation homogeneity across all printed and graphical displays.

@article{vuorre_within-subject_2018,
	abstract = {Statistical mediation allows researchers to investigate potential causal effects of experimental manipulations through intervening variables. It is a powerful tool for assessing the presence and strength of postulated causal mechanisms. Although mediation is used in certain areas of psychology, it is rarely applied in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. One reason for the scarcity of applications is that these areas of psychology commonly employ within-subjects designs, and mediation models for within-subjects data are considerably more complicated than for between-subjects data. Here, we draw attention to the importance and ubiquity of mediational hypotheses in within-subjects designs, and we present a general and flexible software package for conducting Bayesian within-subjects mediation analyses in the R programming environment. We use experimental data from cognitive psychology to illustrate the benefits of within-subject mediation for theory testing and comparison.},

Formulas are provided for the mean and variance of the indirect and total effects and for the sampling variances of the average indirect and total effects. Simulations show that the estimates are unbiased under most conditions. Confidence intervals based on a normal approximation or a simulated sampling distribution perform well when the random effects are normally distributed but less so when they are nonnormally distributed. These methods are further developed to address hypotheses of moderated mediation in the multilevel context. An example demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed methods.},

We describe the methodology, discuss theoretical and practical implications, and demonstrate applications to a factor model and a linear growth curve model.},

Previous works extending tree methods to accommodate correlated data are mainly based on the multivariate repeated-measures approach. We propose a ``mixed effects regression tree'' method where the correlated observations are viewed as nested within clusters rather than as vectors of multivariate repeated responses. The proposed method can handle unbalanced clusters, allows observations within clusters to be split, and can incorporate random effects and observation-level covariates. We implemented the proposed method using a standard tree algorithm within the framework of the expectation-maximization ({EM}) algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed regression tree method provides substantial improvements over standard trees when the random effects are non negligible. A real data example is used to illustrate the method.},

At each node, a user-specified linear or nonlinear mixed-effects model is estimated. This method is an extension of Abdolell et al.'s (2002) longitudinal recursive partitioning while permitting a nonlinear mixed-effects model in addition to a linear mixed-effects model in each node. We give an overview of recursive partitioning, nonlinear mixed-effects models for longitudinal data, describe {nLRP}, and illustrate its use with empirical data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study---Kindergarten Cohort.},

@article{fokkema_detecting_2018,
	abstract = {Identification of subgroups of patients for whom treatment A is more effective than treatment B, and vice versa, is of key importance to the development of personalized medicine. Tree-based algorithms are helpful tools for the detection of such interactions, but none of the available algorithms allow for taking into account clustered or nested dataset structures, which are particularly common in psychological research. Therefore, we propose the generalized linear mixed-effects model tree ({GLMM} tree) algorithm, which allows for the detection of treatment-subgroup interactions, while accounting for the clustered structure of a dataset. The algorithm uses model-based recursive partitioning to detect treatment-subgroup interactions, and a {GLMM} to estimate the random-effects parameters. In a simulation study, {GLMM} trees show higher accuracy in recovering treatment-subgroup interactions, higher predictive accuracy, and lower type {II} error rates than linear-model-based recursive partitioning and mixed-effects regression trees. Also, {GLMM} trees show somewhat higher predictive accuracy than linear mixed-effects models with pre-specified interaction effects, on average. We illustrate the application of {GLMM} trees on an individual patient-level data meta-analysis on treatments for depression. We conclude that {GLMM} trees are a promising exploratory tool for the detection of treatment-subgroup interactions in clustered datasets.},

@article{bringmann_network_2013,
	abstract = {In the network approach to psychopathology, disorders are conceptualized as networks of mutually interacting symptoms (e.g., depressed mood) and transdiagnostic factors (e.g., rumination). This suggests that it is necessary to study how symptoms dynamically interact over time in a network architecture. In the present paper, we show how such an architecture can be constructed on the basis of time-series data obtained through Experience Sampling Methodology ({ESM}). The proposed methodology determines the parameters for the interaction between nodes in the network by estimating a multilevel vector autoregression ({VAR}) model on the data. The methodology allows combining between-subject and within-subject information in a multilevel framework. The resulting network architecture can subsequently be analyzed through network analysis techniques. In the present study, we apply the method to a set of items that assess mood-related factors. We show that the analysis generates a plausible and replicable network architecture, the structure of which is related to variables such as neuroticism; that is, for subjects who score high on neuroticism, worrying plays a more central role in the network. Implications and extensions of the methodology are discussed.},
