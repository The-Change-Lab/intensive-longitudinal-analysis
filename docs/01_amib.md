# AMIB {#amib}

Our examples make use of [**The AMIB Data**](https://thechangelab.stanford.edu/collaborations/the-amib-data/), a multiple time-scale data set that has been shared for teaching purposes.
The data include person-level *dispositions*, *daily* diary assessments, and ecological momentary assessments that were obtained after everyday social *interactions* (event-contingent sampling).

The data are shared with intent to facilitate learning about analysis of *intensive longitudinal data* (from experience sampling, daily diary, or EMA designs).
**The data are posted only for teaching purposes and should not be used for research.**
