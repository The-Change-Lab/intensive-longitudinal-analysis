## Fun Quotes

> “... ideal longitudinal research is characterized by the seamless
> integration of a well-articulated theoretical model of change, an
> appropriate temporal design, and a statistical model that is an
> operationalization of the theoretical model.”
> @collins_analysis_2006

> “Longitudinal methodology involves repeated, time- ordered observation
> of an [entity] or [entities] with the goal of identifying processes
> and causes ...” @nesselroade_longitudinal_1979

> “Intensive longitudinal methods involve sequences of repeated
> measurements sufficiently frequent to allow one to characterize
> [functional form of change + causes and consequences] a separate
> change process for each subject (which can be a person or other
> sampling unit such as dyad or group).”

-   Experience sampling, daily diaries, interaction records, ecological
    momentary assessment, ambulatory assessment, real-time data capture

    -   Justifications: “life as it is lived”, non-ergodicity
        (description of within-person processes)

## Intensive Longitudinal Studies

-   An intensive longitudinal study is one with enough repeated
    measurements to model a distinct change process for each individual
    •

    -   Within-individual variability is key

    -   Time scale: minutes, hours, days, and weeks rather than months
        and years

    -   Used to understand people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as
        it happens

## Information About

This is a *sample* book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything
that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
